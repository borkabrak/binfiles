; Imagine the owner of a movie theater who has complete freedom in setting ticket
; prices. The more he charges, the fewer the people who can afford tickets. In a
; recent experiment the owner determined a precise relationship between the price
; of a ticket and average attendance. At a price of $5.00 per ticket, 120 people
; attend a performance. Decreasing the price by a dime ($.10) increases
; attendance by 15. Unfortunately, the increased attendance also comes at an
; increased cost. Every performance costs the owner $180.  Each attendee costs
; another four cents ($0.04). The owner would like to know the exact relationship
; between profit and ticket price so that he can determine the price at which he
; can make the highest profit.
