/*
Here's a small problem that a client once asked us to solve as part of a larger
project. The client has an existing web-based system for delivering a test
containing multiple choice questions to a learner (the relevant parts of which
are included on this page).  The client asked us to modify this code so that
the test questions are delivered in a random order every time a learner
attempts the test. Furthermore, the order in which the answers to the questions
are presented should also be randomized.

The existing framework for creating and displaying a test has been provided for
you below. Your task is to comprehend the client's code and data structure then
implement the RandomizeTest function to perform the randomization of the
question and answer order.  Please explain your work and thought process.

Some background on the project from the client that may affect your solution:

-There are over 600 of these tests deployed to hundreds of thousands of users
-There are never more then 20 questions or so per test, each with no more than
6 answers but the code should be able to handle an arbitrary number or both
questions and answers 
-This code is maintained by several developers in
different organizations 
-The code is only required to work in all modern
browsers

When submitting your response, please rename this file to include your name.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

    //  * That last question.. keep getting 'undefined'  What the.. I don't even.
    //  * Oh.. yuck, this solution is sloppy, but this is where it belongs..
    //  * Okay, that was NOT exactly 'easy', but man, that was fun!  Thanks for the challenge!

            folks), but the error is in the test data, so this seems the best
            place to handle it.  Ideally, we'd ensure correct data, and
            wouldn't that be a nice world?

            Discarding superfluous answers and assuming zero/false for missing
            ones is definitely a judgement call, but one that seems reasonable
            to me.
