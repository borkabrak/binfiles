#   apti/sapti
#
#   Shorthand interface to aptitude with options I will usually want.
#
#   'apti' - short for 'aptitude'
#   'sapti' - short for 'sudo aptitude'
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
#   First, run any normal aptitude operation as given.
#
#   If first param is not an aptitude <action>:
#     When run as 'apti' default to 'search'.
#     When run as 'sapti' default to 'install' (with 'sudo' and a prompt to confirm.)
#
# EXAMPLE TRANSLATIONS (options not shown):
#   
#       apti string             => aptitude search string
#
#       sapti package           => sudo aptitude install package
#
#       apti show package       => aptitude show package
#
#       sapti search package    => sudo aptitude search package
